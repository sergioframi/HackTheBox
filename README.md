Hi everyone! My name is Sergio and I'm on my road to get the OSCP. So, as I'm doing all the boxes I can from htb, IÂ´m doing some writeups as training and I'd like to share them with you. Please, feel free to reach me if you want to comment anything (tw: [@sergioframi](https://twitter.com/sergioframi)).
